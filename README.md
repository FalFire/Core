Core
====

These are sources from some plugin libraries offered by Happening.

They make a lot of assumptions about how to render things, making it sometimes hard to use these libraries for your specific needs. Some examples:
- you want to add a single new gesture to the `photoview`; 
- you want to use `social`'s commenting ability, but allow for anonymous comments;
- you want to use `chat`, but render messages in reverse; 

Instead of the core platform supporting a myriad of different options to accomodate all such cases, we offer these files so you can fork a copy in your own project and modify as seen fit. 

Note that not all of them might work as-is (survive the sandbox-check). Let us know if this poses a problem.

TODO
